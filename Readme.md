Stor is a Go package that makes exporting databases easy and fun. It provides support for cron jobs so exports can be made periodically according to a schedule, exports can be uploaded to AWS S3, Google Drive, FTP and saved locally.

Stor supports multiple databases, so exports can be made of multiple databases at a time.
